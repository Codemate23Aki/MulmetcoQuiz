# ðŸŽ‰ Backend Setup Complete!

Your Flask API backend is now ready! Here's what's been set up:

âœ… Virtual environment created (`venv/`)
âœ… Dependencies installed
âœ… Environment file created (`.env`)
âœ… Firebase credentials configured

## Next Steps:

### 1. Add your OpenAI API Key
Edit the `.env` file and replace the placeholder:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Start the API Server
```bash
# Make sure you're in the backend directory and virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate
python app.py
```

### 3. Test the API
Once running, you can test:
- Health check: http://localhost:5000/health
- The Flutter app will automatically use the `/generate-questions` endpoint

## Integration with Flutter

The Flutter app is already configured to:
1. Create a quiz in Firestore
2. Call your API to generate 20 Uganda-based questions
3. Update the quiz with the generated questions
4. Display the quiz in "My Races"

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Make sure your OpenAI API key is valid
2. Check that Firebase credentials are correct
3. Ensure the virtual environment is activated
4. Check the console logs for detailed error messages

Enjoy your AI-powered quiz generation! ðŸš€
